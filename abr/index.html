				<br><br>
				<strong>I reframe the initial issue statement </strong>  by asking where the money is. 
				<br>
				The answer to such a simple question lets me understand the business and find, define, and solve Key Issues.<br>

				<h4>Situation to avoid</h4>
					There are 5 people supposed to sign a contract to receive the money. None of them gets anything until all sign the contract. Sometimes one of them can not sign the contract because the email address is wrong.

				<h4>Benefit</h4>
					By technically checking the validity of the email address and informing the user in case the email is wrong, we are increasing the value of service to the customer. The customer is ready to pay more for the service, the customer's value increases.

					<strong>👨‍💼 </strong> – I want 80 % of newly registered individual users to sign one of our predefined documents. <br>
					<strong>Me</strong> – Ok, we can make on-boarding shorter, the steps clearer, CTAs more focused, Dashboard more helpful, etc. but <br>
					<strong>Me</strong> – <strong> Where is the money? </strong> <br>
					
					<strong>👨‍💼 </strong> – Existing, already paying customers sometimes can not sign the contract. <br>
					<strong>Me</strong> – ??? <br>
					<strong>👨‍💼 </strong> – There are 5 people supposed to sign a contract to receive the money. None of them gets anything until all sign the contract. Quite often happens that one of them can not sign the contract because the email address is wrong.  <br>
					<strong>Me</strong> – But the system doesn't provide info about such a situation and that is <strong> the key issue </strong>. So we need to check the validity of email and provide info to the user in case the email is wrong.

				The accountant has prepared the list of payment orders. He is already late for kindergarten. And now he is supposed to retype the payment orders one by one, into the form. And he is losing precious time he already doesn't have.

					<h4>Benefit</h4>
						To process payments, importing the list of payment orders into the system is a key issue.
						By automatically recognizing the format of the file and processing it without unnecessary interaction with the user, we are greatly improving Customer Experience and also gain a competitive advantage. <br>
						Last but not least, we are not wasting time and resources on fine-tuning the form no one uses.

				<strong>👨‍💼👨‍💼</strong> – We want you to optimize the form for payment order in e-banking for enterprise clients segment. <br>
				<strong>Me</strong> – But there is no money in the form. <br>
				
				<strong>👨‍💼👨‍💼</strong> – ??? <br>
				<strong>Me</strong> – Even SME segment users are uploading the list of payment orders, they don't use the form. So we should focus on improving the import of the payment orders file. <br>
				<strong>👨‍💼👨‍💼</strong> – Ok?  <br>
				<strong>Me</strong> – At least we should recognize the format of the file without compelling the users to tell us. <br>
				<strong>👨‍💻</strong> – But it will not work in 100 % of the cases. <br>
				<strong>Me</strong> – Well, nothing does. 80 % is good enough. There are like 4 ERP providers, so 80 % should be achievable.

				<h4>Benefit</h4>
					The templates for the documents sent to the client allow us
					<ul>
						<li>reduce employees' time needed for docs preparation and unwanted creativity</li>
						<li>avoid the danger of the client misunderstanding the message</li>
						<li>save client's time while reading the message</li>
						<li>cut unnecessary extra communication to zero</li>
					</ul>


				The templates must support the type of the document (simple message, meeting request, etc.), and also . And at the same time, the templates must be consistent. 
				So, we must build the templates out of the building blocks. 
				So, at first, we must identify and describe the building blocks (header, time, place, name of the project, etc.).

					<h4>Description</h4>
				
					
					<strong>Me</strong> – You send clients quite many documents during the agreement life-cycle. The documents' content varies from a simple message to meeting requests with additional statements and reports required. <br>
					
					<strong>👨‍💼</strong> – Ok? <br>
					<strong>Me</strong> – The documents are a mess. Even similar ones are very different. In many cases the message is not clear, the important info is hidden, etc. <br>
					<strong>👨‍💼</strong> – Ok?  <br>
					<strong>Me</strong> – I'll go through the docs, you will get the templates. <br>
					<strong>👨‍💼</strong> – Ok.
